# Make Js Component

Make Js Component is an NPX command born with the purpose of streamline the process for developers of creating components with the many FE frameworks around here.

Since some frameworks have standard commands, some had them, some really don't, the quickest thing is usually copy pasting compononent after component and then edit it.

MJC allows you to just call a command and have your JS component ready to use, and edit, with also a bunch of options available in order to start with the perfect boilerplate.

You can't find the framework or the options you need? Checkout the [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and open an issue to let us know and, if you wish, you can open a PR to have the feature inclued in the command!
