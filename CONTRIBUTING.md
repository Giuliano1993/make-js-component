### Getting started locally

1. Clone the repo
2. In the repo folder run `npm run dev`; this will start watching ts files and transpile them to js
3. Now you can run locally the command: just type `npx .` in your terminal to execut it


### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue please follow these steps:

1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
2. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible
3. if you wish to work on the Issue please check the relative checkbox

### Working on an Issue 

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you
2. after the Issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
3. **only** start working on this Issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you.
4. when forking the issue, create a branch for your edits
5. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #123`)
6. please do **not** force push to your PR branch, this makes it very difficult to re-review - commits will be squashed when merged


### Pull requests
Remember, before opening a PR, to have an issue assigned to work on! If you have an idea but you don't find any issue for it, first open an issue and ask to have it assigned! This way you don't risk to work on something which is already being worked on or that isn't needed right now!
When the issue is assigned to you, you're welcome to start working on it, I'll be glad to merge it!
